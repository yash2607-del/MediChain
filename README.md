The transaction hash is saved in the backend database, linked to the relevant doctor, patient, and pharmacy identifiers.

The pharmacy retrieves and verifies the prescription hash from the blockchain before dispensing medication.

Patients can view all verified prescriptions via their secure dashboards.

AI Chatbot Workflow

The patient describes symptoms through the chatbot interface.

The generative AI model analyzes the input and classifies symptoms into medical specializations.

The system retrieves and displays a list of relevant doctors based on specialization and location.

Medicine Search and Map Integration

Pharmacies regularly update available medicines in the system.

Patients can search for a specific medicine name.

The platform queries all participating pharmacies, filtering results by geolocation.

Nearby pharmacies are displayed on an interactive map with detailed information and directions.
